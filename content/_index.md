#### About
I'm a graduate student at The UC Berkeley Goldman School, where I study policy analysis and applied data science. I'm interested in social policy broadly and using quantitative/computational methods to improve program delivery.   

I teach Public Policy 297, "Data Management, Analysis and Visualization", a graduate level introduction to professional data analysis.  

You can learn more about my professional history in my [resume]().
