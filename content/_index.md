#### About
I'm a graduate student at the UC Berkeley Goldman School of Public Policy, where I study policy analysis and applied data science. I'm interested in social policy, program evaluation, and computational methods.

At Goldman I also teach Public Policy 297, *Data Management, Analysis and Visualization*, a graduate level introduction to professional data analysis.
