During the Fall semesters of 2021 and 2022, I taught a course at the UC Berkeley Goldman School of Public Policy called *Public Policy 297: Data Management, Analysis, and Visualization* (PP297). The course is, at it's core, a basic introduction to data analysis using Excel, typically taught by a second year Master of Public Policy student. I am, I believe, the only student to have taught it twice, so have spent a lot of time thinking about the course, what it can and can't accomplish, and how it relates to the Goldman core. I wanted to take a moment to record those thoughts for my own reference.

## Course Philosophy
> After 20 years of
teaching, Iâ€™ve come to the conclusion that teaching skills works
better than teaching concepts (or, should I say, trying to teach
concepts).  

-- [Andrew Gelman](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/teachingbayes.pdf)

The core idea of PP297 is to teach students data analysis skills that are obviously in-demand by public policy employers. Around lecture 4 or 5 I like to make this especially clear by showing students a sample of descriptions of what "Advanced Excel Proficiency" means in job descriptions -- the takeaway being those are the skills the course focused on.

## Using Excel to Teach Data Science
When I first started teaching PP297, I had a strong desire to transition material to be more focused on getting students to use Python or R as fast as possible. I now believe that Excel based instruction is extremely valuable for introducing students to data science and computation. The core reasons for this are as follows:
- Excel is visual and you can easily see and click on all assigned variables (cells)
- Excel requires minimal typing of variable and function names
- Excel allows of the use of the logic and functions necessary to teach students about basic programming control-flow

Excel is, of course, insufficient as a tool for advanced data analysis, but for basic and intermediate tasks it is well suited.
